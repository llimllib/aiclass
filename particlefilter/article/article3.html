    <p>The problem is, Alpha doesn't know which square he's in. In order to find
    himself, he has two tools: he can move, and he can sense whether there are
    walls around him or not.

    <p>Unfortunately for him, he can neither move nor sense the walls reliably. 80%
    of the time he can move where he wants to, but 20% of the time he will move 90
    degrees from where he wants to; if the grid spot in that direction is invalid,
    he will fail to move at all.

    <p>His wall sensors work similarly; 75% of the time they return the correct
    mesaurement in any given direction, but the other 25% they fail. Since he can
    measure walls in the north, east, south, and west directions, he will only get
    a completely correct measurement of his current situation about 32% of the
    time.

    <p>Use the arrow keys to play with moving him around a bit, and you'll see how
    he often fails to move and how his sensors are often wrong (indicated by a red
    measurement):
