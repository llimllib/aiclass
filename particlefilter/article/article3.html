<p>The problem is, Alpha doesn't know which square he's in. In order to find
himself, he has two tools: he can move, and he can sense whether there are
walls around him or not.

<p>Unfortunately for him, he can neither move nor sense the walls reliably. 80%
of the time he can move where he wants to, but 20% of the time he will move 90
degrees from where he wants to; if the grid spot in that direction is invalid,
he will fail to move at all.

<p>His wall sensors work similarly; 75% of the time they return the correct
mesaurement in any given direction, but the other 25% they fail. Since he can
measure walls in the north, east, south, and west directions, he will only get
a completely correct measurement of his current situation about 32% of the
time.

<p>Use the arrow keys to play with moving him around a bit, and you'll see how
he often fails to move and how his sensors are often wrong (indicated by a red
measurement):
