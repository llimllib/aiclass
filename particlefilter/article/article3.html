<p>The problem is, Alpha doesn't know which square he's in. In order to find 
himself, he has two tools: he can move, and he can sense whether there are 
walls around him or not.

<p>Unfortunately for him, he can neither move nor sense the walls reliably. 80% 
of the time he can move where he wants to, but 20% of the time he will move 90 
degrees from where he wants to; if the grid spot in that direction is invalid, 
he will fail to move at all.

<p>His wall sensors work similarly; 95% of the time they return the correct 
mesaurement in any given direction, but the other 5% they fail. Since he can 
measure walls in the north, east, south, and west directions, he will only get 
a completely correct measurement of his current situation about 81% of the 
time.

<p>Play with moving him around a bit, and you'll see how he often fails to move 
and how his sensors may be wrong:
