    <p>If Alpha is to find himself, he's going to need to find a way to overcome 
    his unreliable movement and sensors.

    <p>Which is where particle filters come in. The basic idea is that we want to 
    make some number <em>N</em> of imaginary robots, scatter them around the world 
    we're in, then measure how likely each one is to accord with the measurements 
    we've made.

    <p>With this in mind, we again make <em>N</em> imaginary robots, but this time 
    place them according to the likelihood we measured in the first step.

    <p>Then we again measure how likely each one is according to our new 
    measurement, and the cycle continues.

    <p>Each "imaginary robot" is called a particle, and is paired with a weight.

    <p>Here is the core of the algorithm in javascript:

    <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic">//move right, we move the particle right with the same probability as the </span>
    <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic">//robot. In our case, that means that the particle has an 80% chance of </span>
    <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic">//moving in the intended direction.</span>
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">var</span> xp <span style="color: #666666">=</span> update_particle(j, control);

    <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic">//Now measure how likely it is that the particle measured what the robot </span>
    <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic">//measured, and use that as the weight of the particle</span>
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">var</span> wp <span style="color: #666666">=</span> update_weight(xp, measurement);

    <span style="color: #408080; font-style: italic">//and push the new (weight, particle) pair</span>
    new_weights.push(xp);
    new_particles.push(wp);
}
